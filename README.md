# OS-Simulation
Simulating CPU scheduling algorithms and file/directory system of an OS using Java This was made as a group project for Data structures Lab.

## Components of the project
### File system
Data Structures used - Multiway tree, arraylist We created a file management system using a tree data structre Each node in the tree can have multiple children We can perform following operations - Create file, delete file, show file path of a file, search for a file

##Algorithms
Data Structures used - Queues, Arrays Algorithms used - sorting techniques Contains CPU scheduling algorithms- FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority scheduling The arrival time of these processes is noted in real-time. A process for this project is considered to be any operation done in the file system. The time for the operation is noted and used as arrival time
